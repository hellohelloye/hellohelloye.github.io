<a href="https://github.com/tbruyelle/RxPermissions">RxPermission</a> is an elegant Android acquire permissions tool. I think RxPermission is brilliant. 
			<br>Lately, I was trying to implement the RxPermission library followed by your GitHub repository. 
<br>But I met quite a few issue, I hope my suggestion would be convenient for more developers. 
I realize it mentioned RxJava, but I think it is better also put RxJava dependences library together with rxpermissions:
<br><font color="blue">compile 'com.tbruyelle.rxpermissions:rxpermissions:0.9.3@aar'</font>
<br><font color="blue">compile 'io.reactivex:rxjava:1.2.2'</font>
<br>The missing of rxjava dependence took me a little bit while to figure it out.
The second issue is quite important about your sample code. The reason I am applying RxPermission library is to expect a more straightforward result about a default pop-up window from google to ask permission from user. 
<br>But from your sample code, I found you create your own customer pop-up window to enable the rxPermission.request permission function. I think this approach is very silly. 

<br>I think the best way to apply rxpermission with default google permission acquire window would be connected with <font color="blue">manifests</font> 
<br><span class="redText">uses-permission android:name="android.permission.RECORD_AUDIO"</span>as example.
